			<h1>A bit more about Cosmo's Pizza</h1>
			<p>Cosmo was a quite man, with many important things on his mind. He considered every decision deeply. He worried about the future of his family, and of his community. Finally, he decided that the <strong>only way to protect the ones he loved, was to learn to make the finest pizza's the world have even seen.</strong></p><br>
