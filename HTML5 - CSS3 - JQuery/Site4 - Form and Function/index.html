		<form action="http://hunter-washers-55673.bitballoon.com" accept-charset="UTF-8" autocomplete="on" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded" method="POST" name="awesomeForm" id="awesomeForm" target="_blank"> 

			<!-- The <form> tag defins an HTML form for user input. Below, I will list out and explain each of the attributes, and cooresponding attribute values, of the form tag. -->

			<!-- The accept-charset attribute specifies the character encodings that are used for the form submission. Some examples character encodings are 'UTF-8' (character encoding for Unicode) 'ISO-8859-1' (character encoding for the Latin alphabet) and 'ASCII' (American Standard Code for Information Unterchange) -->
			
			<!-- The action attribute specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submittedm as a URL. The URL destinations can be absolute, or relative.-->

			<!-- The autocomplete attribute specifies weather a form should have autocomplete on or off. The autocomplete values are based on values that have user has entered before, at any time in their browser. --> 
			<!-- CANT GET THIS TO WORK YET-->
			
			<!-- The enctype attribute specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitting it to a server. There are three value options for this enctype attribute: 1) "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"  2) "multipart/form-data"  3) "text/plain". 

			To further explain enctype attribute value: The "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" type is the default type of encoding. In this case, all characters are encoded before sent (spaces are converted to "+" symbols, and special characters are converted to ASCII HEX values). 

			With the "multipart/form-data" enctype attribute value, no characters are encoded. This value is required when you are using a form that has a file upload control. 

			Lastly, the "text/plain" enctype attribute value, spaces are converted to "+" symbols, but no special characters are encoded. 

			As you can see above, I have chosen to use the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" attribute value. -->

			<!-- The method attribute specifies how to send form-data. The default form data submission method is GET, or (method="get"). This appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs.

			The other form data submission method is POST, or (method="post") The POST form data submission method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction.  

			There are a few things to remember when using the GET and POST attribute values for the method attribute:

			Notes on GET:
				- GET appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs
				- The length of the URL is limited (to about 3000 characters)
				- You should never use get to send sensitive data! (because the data is visable in the URL)
				- GET method is useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result.
				- GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

			Notes on Post:
				- POST appends form-data inside the body of the HTTP request (data is not shown in the URL)
				- POST form-data submission have no size limitations
				- Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked 
				-->

			<!-- The form attribute value "name", is simply used to name the form. In this example, I've named the form "name="awesomeForm" -->

			<!-- The 'novalidate' form attribute specifies that the form should not be validated when submitted. As a refresher, remember that form validation is a feature that does not allow the respondent to submit a reply until all required questions are completed properly. Sometimes this is also referred to 'restriction' Also, remember that the novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute.

			You can see that in this example, I've chosen not to use it. I want my forms to be validated by default. -->

			<!-- The last form attribute is 'target'. The 'target' attribute specifies where to display the response that is received back from the server, after submitting the form.

			There are five attrubute values for the target form attribute: 
				1) "_blank" ---- the response is displayed in a new window or tab
				2) "_self" ---- the response is displayed in the same frame (the is the default)
				3) "_parent" ---- the response is displayed in the parent frame
				4) "_top" ---- the response is displayed in the full body of the window
				5) "framename" ---- the response is displayed in the named iframe
			
			You can see that I've chosen to use the target="blank" value, because I want the form server response to display in a new page. -->

			<!-- The input tag specifies an input feild where the user can input data. <input> elements are used within a form element to declare input controls where users can input data. The <input> feild can vary in many ways, depending on the type of sttribute. Below, I will list out and explain each of the input attributes, and cooresponding attribute values, for the input tag. -->

			<!-- The 'accept' input attribute, is a sub-attribute of the 'type'attribute, and a co-addtibute to the 'file' attribute, specifies the types of files that a server can accept. There are four value options for this attribute: 

				1) "audio/*" ---- all sound files are accepted
				2) "video/*" ---- all video files are accepted
				3) "image/*" ---- all image files are accpeted
				4) "MIME_type" -- (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, which later became known as Internet Media Types) Any valid MIME type, with no parameters. The list is extensive, and can be found here: http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml

			I have used a seperate input field for each one of these file-type accept attributes. You'll note that the file-type I've chosen for MIME_type is ".csv" -->

			<!-- The next input attribute is the 'alt' attribute. The alt attribute provides an alternate text for the user, if he or she for some reason cannot view the intended image (or other content). -->

			<!-- 'The autocomplete' input tag attribute specifies whether an input element should have autocomplete enabled. Remember that both a form tag, and an input tag can contain the autocomplete attribute. Esentially, autocomplete allows the browser to predict the value. When a user starts to type in a field, the browser should display options to fill in the feild, based on earlier typed values. You'll notice above that I've inclued an input type for both, On and Off.-->

			<!-- The 'autofocus' input tag attribute specifies that an <input> element should automatically get focus when the page loads.  -->

			<!-- The 'checked' input tag attribute specifies that an input element should be pre-selected when the page loads (for type="checkbox" or type="radio). The cheched attribute can also be set after the page load, using Javascript. Remember, you can only use the 'checked' attribute with the type="checkbox" or type="radio". I've encluded two examples of both styles. --> 

			<!-- The 'disabled' input tag attribute is used when an input element should be disabled. A disabled input element is unusable and un-clickable. The disabled attribuete can be set to keep a user from using teh input element until some other consitions has ben met (like selecting a checkbox), ect. Then, a JavaScript could remove the disabled value, and make the input element usable. Remeber, the disabled elements in a form will not be submitted. Also remember, the disabled attribute will not  work with <input type="hidden" -->

			<!-- The 'form' input tag attribute specifies one or more forms the input element belongs to. The value of this attribute must be the same id attribute of a form element in the same document. This form="id" attribute can be useful if a submit button is above other included input fields. Remember that a form 'name' applies ot the whole form, whereas a form 'id' applies to more of a css style identification.-->

			<!-- The 'formaction' input tag attribute specifies the URL of the file that will process the input control when the form is submitted, (for type="submit" and type="image") the 'formaction' attribute overrides the other, 'action' attribute of the <form> element. This override feature might be useful if you are building a form that has two types of user submit buttons, regular and admin, for example. -->

			<!-- The 'formenctype' input tag attribute, specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitting to the server. This applies to type="submit" and type="image". This formenctype only applies to forms with method="post". There are three values for the formenctype attribute:

				1) application/x-www-form-urlencoded - Default. All characters are encoded before sent. (spaces are converted to "+" symbols, and special characters are converted to ASCII HEX values)
				2) multipart/form-data - No characters are encoded
				3) text/plain - spaces are converted to "+", but no special characters are encoded -->

			<!-- The 'formmethod' attribute defines th HTTP method for sending form-data to the action URL. The formmethod attribute overrides the more broad 'method' attribue from the <form> tag. As with the other examples of encoding attributes, the formmethod attribute can be used with type="submit" and type="image". The form-data that is submitted can be submitted as URL variables (method="get") or as HTTP post transcation (method="post"). Remember that there a few concepts of import relative to the "get" method and the "post" method:

			Get Method:
				- The get method appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs.
				- The get method is useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result. 
				- With the get method, there is a limit to how much data you can place in a URL, (varies between browsers), therefore, you cannot be sure that all of the form data will be correctly transferred. 
				- Never use the get method to paas sensitive information. (Password and other sensitive information is visible in the broswers address bar.)

			Post Method:
				- The post method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction
				- Form submissions with the post method cannot be bookmarked. 
				- The post method is more robust and secure than "get". Data transfer is unlimited with the Post method. -->
			
			<!-- The 'formnovalidate' input tag attrubute defines that form elements should not be validated when submitted. It is a boolean attribute. As with several other elements, it overrides the novalidate attribute of the <form> element. -->

			<!-- The 'formtarget' input tag attribute specifies where to display the response that is received from the server after submitting the form. The 'formtarget' attribute overrides the target in the <form> element. Remember that the 'formtarget' attribute can be used with both type="submit" and type="image" 
			
				The five types of attribute values for the 'formtarget' tag are:
				1) "_blank" - the response is displayed in a new window
				2) "_self" - the response is displayed in the same frame (this is default)
				3) "_parent" - the response is displayed in the parent frame
				4) "_top" - the response is displayed in the full body of the window
				5) framename - the response is displayed in the named iframe -->

			<!-- The 'height' attribute of the input tag specifies the height (in pixels) of an <input> element (used only for type="image".) A tip about the 'height' attribute for the input tag: 

				Always specify both the height and width attributes for images. If height and width are set, the space required for the image is reserved, when the page is loaded. However, without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. The effect will be that the page layout wil change during loading (while images load). In the above example you'll notice that I used both height and width. -->

			<!-- The 'list' attrubute for the input tag refers to a <datalist> element that contains pre-defined options for an input element. The 'list' attribute value is an id that is equiviliant to the id of a seperate datalist. You will notice in my code that I've used both the <input> tag (with id) and the <datalist> tag. -->

			<!-- The 'max' attribute for the input tag specifies the maximum value for an input element. There are two types of values allowed for this element.
				1) number - specifes the maximum value allowed.
				2) date - specifies the maximum date allowed.

			Remember, you can use the 'max' attribute together with the 'min' attribute to create a range of legal values. -->

			<!-- The 'maxlength' attribute for the input tag specifies the maximum nuber of characters allowed in an <input> element. Interestingly, the default value is 524288 characters! -->

			<!-- The 'min' attribute for the input tag specifies a minimum value for an input element. We've just recently covered this, in the 'max' attribute section. -->
			
			<!-- The 'multiple' attribute for the input tag specifies that a user can enter more than one value in an input element. This is a boolean attribute. The 'multiple' attribute works with the following input types:
				1) email
				2) file

			Remember, that for the <input type="file">: to select multiple files, hold down the control key or the shift key while selecting. Also, for the <input type="email">: seperate each email with a comma. -->

			<!-- The 'name' attribute specifies the name of the input element. The name attribute is used to reference elements in a Javascript, or to reference form data after a form is submitted. Important note: only form elements with a name attribute wil hav thier values passed when submitting a form. --> 

			<!-- The 'pattern' attribute for the input tag specifies a regular expression (a sequence of javascript characters that form a search pattern.) that an input element is checked against. The pattern attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, email, tel, and password. Use the global title attribute to describe the pattern to help the user. 
			
				More information about Regular Expressions: 
				- A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a serach pattern. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.
				- A regular expression can be a single character, or a complicated pattern. Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. 

				Regular Expression Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive more global searches:

					'i' - perform case sensitive matching
					'g' - perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match)
					'm' - perform multiline matching

				Regular Expression Patterns are comprised of several other types of characters:

				Brackets are used to find a range of characters:
					'[abc]' - find any of the characters between the brackets
					'[0-9]' - find any of the digits between the brackets
					'(x|y)' - find any of these alternatives, seperated with |

				Metacharacters are characters with special meaning:
					'\d' - find a digit
					'\s' - find a whitespace character
					'\b' - find a match at the beginning or at the end of a word
					'\uxxxx' - find the unicode character specified by the hexidecimal number xxxx
				
				Quantifiers define quantities:
					'n+' - matches any string that contains at least one 'n'
					'n*' - matches sny string that contains zero or more more occurances of 'n'
					'n?' - matches any string that contains zero or one occurances -->
			<!--  The placeholder attribute of the input tag specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input element. The short hint is displayed in the input feild before the user enters a value. The placeholder attribute workds with the following input types: text, search, url, email, and password.  -->

			<!-- The 'readonly' attribute specifies that an input field is read-only. The readonly attribute is a boolean attribute. A readonly input feild cannot be modified. (However, a user can tab to it, highlight it, and copy the text from it.) The readonly attribute can be set to keep a user from changing the value until some other conditions have been met (like selecting a checkbox, etc.) Then a JavaScript can remove the readonly value, and make the input field editable. -->

			<!-- The 'required' attribute input tag specifies that an input feild must be filled out before submitting the form. The 'required' attribute is a boolean attribute. The 'required' attribute works with the following types: text, url, tel, email, password, date pickers, number, checkbox, radio, and file.  -->

			<!-- The 'size' attribute for the input tag specifies the width, in characters, of an <input> element. The 'size' attribute works with the following input types: text, search, tel, url, email, password. Remember, the specify the maximum number of characters allowed in the input elemnt, use the 'maxlength' attribute. -->
				
			<!-- The 'src' attribute input tag specifies the URL of the image to use as a submit button (only for type="image"). Again, the 'src' attribute is required for <input type="image">, and can only be used with <input type="image">. The URL destination can be both absolutel or relative. -->

			<!-- The 'step' attribute specifies the legal nunber of intervals for an input field. For example, if step="3", legal numbers would be -3, 0, 3, 6, ect. Remember that the 'step' attribute can be used together with the 'max and 'min' attributes to create a range of legal values. Also, the 'step' attribute works with the following input types: number, range, date, datetime, datetime-local, month, time and week. Also remember that the default is step value is 1. -->
